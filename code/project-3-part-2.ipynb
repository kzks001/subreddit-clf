You know he started a phony school and tried to bilk 25 million dollars from Americans, just like you, who were only trying to better themselves. In both instances, he ADDMITTED guilt and REIMBURSED the money, and paid millions in fines. In addition, neither he nor any of his children are permitted to engage in any charity in the State of New York. You know he gave depositions in two states in July to answer charges of running a scam and cheating on his taxes.

So what's up with that? Has Nevada been complacent compared to somewhere like GA with much more encouraging numbers? How is Nevada looking to someone who understands their politics?\n",

    "For the specific subreddits we scrapped, we ran into problems with overfitting of the train data. We have tried 3 methods (1 of them is not shown) to deal with the overfitting problem. We started by reducing the criterion (number of characters) from 80 to 60 for `title` to be deemed to \"contain\" enough words to be substituted/added to `selftext`. This helped to increase the number of documents we have by close to double, it did little to reduce overfitting though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we tried to remove words that occur frequently but do not have high coefficients. That is, we have specified those words as noise and have tried to remove them. Our attempts did not seem to be too successful as both the train and test scores were dropping with the overfitting problem not improving.\\\n",
    "On hindsight, our method for selecting the words to remove seems too rudimentary, where we only considered if the words occur with high frequency and if they are in the top 50 words with large coefficients. We could instead have specified that for some limiting frequency f, and some limiting coefficient c, if frequency of of word > f and coefficient of word < c, then we drop that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we used `modeling_worker` to \"guess\" which combination of estimator and transformer would give a good score that is also not overfitted. We then proceeded to tune that particular combination in an attempt to produce a good model. It turns out, either we were tuning the model in the wrong way, or using such a method to choose which combination to use is equivalent to trying to predict the lottery. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of all the methods that we have attempted, we find that the model produced in the very first iteration is the \"best\", not in terms of least underfitting but taking into account the trade off between being overfitted but still being able to predict well.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, we will talk about the top words and their coefficients. In particular, for the method where we were removing words, by the third iteration, it seems that the coefficients for the words became very significant, but recall that the scores have also dropped as well, meaning that even though the words are very significant, they are only able to explain a smaller part of the variance as compared to if we had more words. I.e., it is not very helpful to talk about the coefficients of a word if the model score was very low in the first place. "

    "In an extension of our work, once we obtain a reliable model, we could generate posts that would look like they are from a certain subreddit based on the top words, perform sentiment analysis to determine if it is a positive or negative post, and use it accordingly to skew public opinions. In such a case however, we would probably want to use a different metric from accuracy, as we would not want to accidentally post a negative sentiment post on Trump's reddit."
